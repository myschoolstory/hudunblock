# Simple Python Web Unblocker

This project is a simple web unblocker implemented in Python. It sets up a local proxy server that allows users to access websites that may be blocked or restricted in their network.

## Disclaimer

This tool is intended for educational purposes only. Please ensure you comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding internet usage and content access in your jurisdiction. I do not accept responsibility for your actions.

## Features

- Access blocked websites through a local proxy.
- Simple and easy to use.
- Lightweight and requires minimal setup.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `urllib3` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files:
   - Use the command: `git clone https://github.com/myschoolstory/hudunblock.git`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd hudunblock`

2. Install the required dependencies:
   - Run the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the unblocker script:
   - Execute: `python unblocker.py`

2. The unblocker will start on port 8000 by default.

3. Access a blocked website by opening your browser and entering the URL in the following format:
   - `http://localhost:8000/blocked-website.com`
   - Replace `blocked-website.com` with the actual URL of the site you wish to access.

## Customization

You can change the port number by modifying the `run_unblocker()` function call in the `unblocker.py` file:
- Change it to your desired port number, for example, `run_unblocker(port=8080)`.

## Limitations

- This is a basic implementation and may not work for all websites or bypass all restrictions. I might add more features in the future.
- The unblocker does not provide encryption or advanced features found in commercial VPN services.
